Hi my name is david, and this is Plateau a web3, trustless job search / payroll platform

the idea is very simple:

let's say someone I a logo, a jewel or just brush my cat, and I have 100 dollars, so this I goes to Plateau, connects my wallet and writes the description, adds the amount to be paid and stores the value inside an escrow contract. 

so people using farcast, via miniapp can connect with the potential employer, send their application using their farcaster as a portfolio.

After getting hired the employer has the abillity to release a partial amount if the job needs it or depending on the agreement, if everything goes as expected the employer releases the full amount.

if issues arise, the employer or the employee could call a third party to review if the criteria was met and release the funds.
